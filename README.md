# Android Chess Engines Testing
Tournament results, speed tests, testing scripts, ... of some very strong Android engines available in my repos. 
At the moment, tournaments with armv8 builds of SFnps230227, SFSnps230227, and CFishNN_230302 are on the way. 
Reasonable tests with my old hardware needs time. Test equipment: 
Amazon FireHD8 (7th gen.), CfA v6.2.1,  Parallel Space App, two instanced of CfA, CPU load < 55% 4th core often stopped.
Thus no final results before 23/03/10.
However, results of the several 100 game matches, made each day, are updated as soon as available [here](https://github.com/Joachim26/Android_Chess_Engines_Testing/blob/main/DailyUpdatedTestResults.txt) and also below:
